# Bantae Copywriting Brief

## Overview

Bantae is a conversational space designed for creative workers — academics, researchers, writers, journalists, designers, technologists, and anyone who thinks best when ideas bounce around in good company. The core promise: humans keep the joy, spontaneity, and flow of real intellectual conversation, while Bantae quietly removes the friction that normally follows. It doesn't replace creativity; it preserves and amplifies it.

This document collects the moods, metaphors, references, and conceptual foundations that should guide any marketing copy. It is intentionally broad and exploratory: a set of directions, tensions, choices, and cultural touchpoints. Use it as a landscape of ideas rather than a script.

**The goal:** create copy that feels warm, intelligent, lightly rebellious, cosmopolitan, and grounded in how creative people actually work.

## Audience

### Primary audience
- Academics and interdisciplinary researchers
- Creative professionals (writers, journalists, designers)
- People who enjoy intellectual banter and collaboration

### Secondary audience
- Neurodiverse thinkers (e.g., ADHD, autistic spectrum)
- Technologists and early adopters

### Shared characteristics
- They believe their job is fundamentally fun

## What Bantae Does (Conceptually)

Bantae recreates the energy of real conversation:
- unstructured, yet rich
- spontaneous, yet meaningful
- playful, yet rigorous

Its agents:
- listen
- clarify
- surface connections
- ask sharp questions
- highlight what matters
- keep threads coherent

They participate, but always as helpers. They do not replace human dialogue, they shape it gently and intelligently without altering the social dynamics between humans.

## Setting Analogies and How to Use Them

Bantae sits at the crossroads of several cultural vibes. These can guide copy, but each piece should usually pick one metaphor and stay consistent.

### Option 1: The Café Table / Conference Hallway

The classic academic space: caffeine, laughter, late-night energy, half-formed brilliance, sharp questions. Everyone knows this moment — where ideas start breathing.

### Option 2: Belter Culture (from The Expanse)

For writers unfamiliar with the reference:

Belter culture in *The Expanse* is a mixed, multicultural society built by generations of workers in space. Their language merges dozens of Earth languages into an efficient, expressive dialect. The culture is improvisational, pragmatic, communal, warm, and slightly rebellious. When we reference a "Belter-like" aesthetic, we mean a cosmopolitan, hybrid, fast-moving conversational style — not jargon-heavy sci-fi, but communication shaped by diverse minds thinking together.

### Option 3: The Creative Studio Session

Loose, associative, generative energy — where ideas are tried, stretched, remixed.

### Additional Sci-Fi Reference: The Droid Archetype (R2-D2)

Droids like R2-D2 are helpful, witty, and full of personality while clearly not being human. They are companions with purpose: surfacing information, warning of problems, nudging protagonists in the right direction without taking over.

This is a useful mental model for Bantae's agents:
- personality without uncanny equality
- helpful without hierarchy
- active contributors without social roles
- companions whose mission is to help ideas reach clarity

**A playful one-liner for internal inspiration:**
- "These aren't the droids you're looking for." → "These are the droids you're looking for."

Use sparingly. Meant as an optional wink to those who will get it.

## Interface Logic (High-Level)

Bantae is fundamentally a chat-based space:
- multiple humans
- multiple AI agents
- agents have adjustable personas
- agents contribute to the conversation
- agents are visually distinct, so users know they're artificial

Agents behave like intelligent participants with a clear mission: help the humans think better. They provide clarification, raise good questions, spot contradictions, surface references, and help structure ideas as they form. They support the flow of conversation rather than interrupt it.

## Key Creative Themes

### 1. Humans keep the fun; Bantae keeps the structure

The spark comes from real conversation. Bantae maintains momentum without imposing or intruding.

### 2. Structure appears naturally

Not imposed. Revealed. Emergent from the dialogue.

### 3. Creativity thrives before clarity

Many thinkers — including neurodiverse ones — generate their best insights in that half-bright, associative zone before everything is fully articulated. Bantae helps this phase become productive without forcing premature precision.

### 4. Helping without hierarchy

Agents are not:
- colleagues
- minions
- employees
- overseers

They are companions designed to assist creatively.

### 5. Inclusion without tokenization

Neurodiverse thinkers may find Bantae especially supportive, but this is not the product's identity. Rather, it's an inclusive signal — like LGBTQ-friendly branding in Pride Month — that shows awareness and allyship without dominating the aesthetic.

## Voice Guidelines

### Should sound like
- that clever friend at the conference coffee break
- someone who reads widely and listens closely
- a warm intellectual with a sly smile
- a person who likes ideas more than they like being right

### Should not sound like
- a corporate productivity coach
- a bureaucrat
- a needy AI assistant
- a sci-fi narrator
- a therapist

---

## Word Preferences

### Avoid
- chaos
- optimize
- productivity
- leverage (verb)
- assistant (mostly)
- minion

### Use carefully
- structure
- clarity
- dopamine
- neurodiverse
- sci-fi references
- bar / café metaphors

### Often useful
- spark
- flow
- banter
- threads
- insight
- moment
- momentum

## Neurodiverse Subsection (Internal)

Many neurodiverse thinkers:
- make connections rapidly
- work well in associative conversation
- struggle with admin transitions
- lose energy when capturing fast-moving ideas

Bantae naturally supports this:
- low-friction capture of ongoing dialogue
- gentle structure without rigidity
- no switching modes
- no judgement, no hierarchy

This should guide tone but not surface branding.

## What Success Looks Like

The copy should:
- make research and creative work feel fun again
- celebrate conversation as the birthplace of insight
- present Bantae as the space where ideas stay alive
- communicate sophistication without pretension
- use sci-fi influence as seasoning, not the meal
- feel warm, human, and future-forward
- avoid whining or complaining about research life

The reader should feel understood, energized, and eager to try thinking with Bantae — a tool built for the part of their work they actually love.
